### What's New

FortiWeb Ingress Controller is a solution that combines the functionalities of a Kubernetes Ingress resource with the capabilities of FortiWeb, which works as an Ingress-managed load balancer. Moreover, FortiWeb protects hosted web applications from attacks that target known and unknown exploits. Using multi-layered and correlated detection methods, FortiWeb defends applications from known vulnerabilities and zero-day threats. FortiWeb also offers a machine-learning function that enables it to automatically detect malicious web traffic. In addition to detecting known attacks, the feature can detect potential unknown zero-day attacks to provide real-time protection for web servers.
